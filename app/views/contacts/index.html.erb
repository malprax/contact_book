  <p>￼I am attaching the draft requirements/wireframes for the website. As I said, this is just the first phase of website so we are developing bare minimum website. Please note webpages like Contact us, Promotions/Offers, About Us, Term and Condition etc are not mentioned in the attached requirements but we will need those.   Also, as I mentioned earlier this is a new development from scratch.
